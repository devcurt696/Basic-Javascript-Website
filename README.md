# Dynamic website with JavaScript
This was a project for my client-side scripting course. It has a home page that takes in and stores a user name to local storage, an about page with an automatic side changer, a gallery, a contact form with validation, and a randomn number game. Let me know if there is anything I can improve!

# Updates
I have made some improvements to the site for responsiveness and accuracy. I made media queries to make the navbar disappear into a hamburger menu for devices with small screen sizes, and made sure all components were responsive. Also added functionality for the image gallery to automtically change slides.
